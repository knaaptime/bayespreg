"""Fill-in estimation for sparse factorization routing.

Estimates the ratio ``nnz(W²) / nnz(W)`` — the growth in nonzeros from the
first sparse-sparse product — in ``O(nnz)`` without materializing ``W²``.
This ratio directly predicts Cholesky/LU factorization cost: the factor's
nonzero count is bounded below by the fill-in from the first elimination
steps, which ``W²`` captures.

The estimate is an **upper bound**: for each row ``i`` it sums the degrees of
``i``'s neighbors, which overcounts shared neighbors but never undercounts.
This errs toward caution — routing to ``cheb_stochastic`` when the factor
*might* be expensive — which is the safe failure mode.

For dense ``W`` (e.g. a KNN graph stored as a dense array), the ratio is
approximately ``n`` (every row has degree ``n``, every neighbor has degree
``n``), so a dense ``n = 2,000`` matrix gives a ratio near 2,000.

    ----------
    W
        Sparse CSR matrix (spatial weights).  Dense arrays should be
        converted to CSR before calling.

    -------
    float

        nonzeros.

    Notes
    -----
    The estimate is an upper bound on the true ``nnz(W²)`` because it
    double-counts neighbors shared between multiple neighbors of the same
    row.  For a regular lattice (e.g. 2D rook with degree ``d``) the ratio
    is approximately ``d``; for a dense matrix it is approximately ``n``;
    for a hub-dominated graph it can be much larger than the mean degree.
